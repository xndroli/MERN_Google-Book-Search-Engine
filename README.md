## 🔗 Description <a name = "description"></a>

Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This week, I’ll take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

In order to successfully refactor, I'll be doing the following:

Setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

Modifying the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

Creating an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

Deploying the application to Heroku.
